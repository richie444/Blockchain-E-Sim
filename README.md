## Introduction

The Blockchain eSIM project is a React Native application developed with Expo, utilizing Hardhat for blockchain development and MetaMask for interacting with Ethereum-based networks. This application allows users to manage their eSIM profiles securely using blockchain technology.

## Features

- Secure eSIM profile management
- Integration with Ethereum blockchain
- Use of MetaMask for blockchain transactions
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Animated components and smooth UI

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- Yarn or npm
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mwashavin/Blockchain-E-Sim.git
    cd blockchain-esim
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3. Install Expo dependencies:

    ```sh
    expo install
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Expo development server:

    ```sh
    expo start
    ```

2. Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code provided in the terminal.

## Deploying the Smart Contract

1. Install Hardhat and dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn add hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
    ```

2. Initialize Hardhat:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat
    ```

3. Write your smart contract in the `contracts` directory and compile it:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred network:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
    ```

5. Update your smart contract address in the application configuration.

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```sh
    REACT_NATIVE_METAMASK_APP_ID=your_metamask_app_id
    REACT_NATIVE_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
    ```

2. Configure your blockchain network settings in `config.js`.

## Usage

1. Open the application on your mobile device.

2. Connect your MetaMask wallet.

3. Manage your eSIM profiles securely using the blockchain.

## Blockchain-E-SIM: A Secure and User-Centric Approach to Mobile Identity Management

**Introduction**

The widespread adoption of mobile technology has revolutionized communication and access to information. However, this progress has also introduced security concerns, particularly regarding SIM card registration fraud. Despite mandatory registration in many countries, loopholes and vulnerabilities allow criminals to exploit the system and obtain SIM cards illegally.

**Problem Statement**

Current SIM card registration processes are susceptible to:

- **Synthetic identity fraud:** Creating fake identities to register for SIM cards.
- **Tracking difficulties:** Inability to effectively track offenders within telecom networks.
- **Focus on devices:** Emphasis on device registration instead of user identity verification.

These issues highlight the need for a more robust and user-centric approach.

**Proposed Solution: Blockchain-E-SIM**

Blockchain-E-SIM leverages blockchain technology and decentralized identity (DID) principles to create a secure and user-controlled solution for mobile identity management. 

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Security:** Blockchain technology ensures the immutability and integrity of registration data, significantly reducing the risk of fraud.

- **User Control:** Users have complete control over their digital identities and credentials, deciding what information to share with verifiers. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) allow them to prove they meet specific requirements without revealing personal details.

- **Improved Tracking:** The distributed ledger enables efficient tracking of fraudulent activities across the network.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (or similar platform)
- **Smart Contracts:** Secure code on the blockchain to manage credential issuance and verification processes.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Cryptographic protocols allowing users to prove they possess certain attributes without revealing the underlying information.

**Project Roadmap:**

1. **Phase 1: Development:** Design and implement the core functionalities of the Blockchain-E-SIM system using the chosen technology stack.
2. **Phase 2: Testing & Evaluation:** Conduct rigorous testing to ensure the system's security, performance, and scalability.
3. **Phase 3: Pilot Deployment:** Implement a pilot program with a limited number of users and mobile network operators to gather real-world feedback.
4. **Phase 4: Refinement & Commercialization:** Based on pilot results, refine the system and explore commercialization opportunities with telecom industry partners.
